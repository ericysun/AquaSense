# üöø AquaSense - AI-Powered Shower Scheduler

A humorous website designed as a joke for CS majors who might need a gentle reminder about personal hygiene. 

## What is it?

## Features

- **Always Recommends Showering**: No matter what, the "AI" will tell you to shower immediately
- **Technical Gimmicks**: 
  - Neural networks trained on 47,000+ hygiene datasets
  - IoT shower integration
  - Real-time processing
  - Advanced algorithms
- **Responsive Design**: Works great on both desktop and mobile
- **Easter Eggs**: Click the shower emoji 5 times for a surprise

open index.html
```

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure
- **CSS3**: Styling with Tailwind CSS

## The Joke

This website pokes fun at:
- Over-engineered solutions to simple problems
- AI buzzwords and marketing hype
- CS majors who might forget basic hygiene while coding
- The tendency to use complex technology when a simple reminder would suffice

## Disclaimer

This is purely a joke website. It's not actually powered by AI, and it's designed to be humorous rather than genuinely helpful. The "analysis" is completely fake and always gives the same result.

## Contributing

Feel free to add more jokes, easter eggs, or improve the design! This is meant to be a fun project for the CS community.
